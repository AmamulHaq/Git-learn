            <h2>Git and Github</h2>
            <h3>Git</h3>
            <p>Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes in your code overtime.</p>
            <h3>Github</h3>
            <p>Github is the implementation of git version control. Github is a open source code contributing software
                where you can publish projects code to be corrected by other users. Or simply it is the place where you
                can keep track of your coding journey in a sequential manner.

            <h3>What is README.md?</h3>
            README is nothing but the description about the project or anything as comparable as that.<br>
            For example: We create Readme file in any repository branch to write what the project is about.<br>
            At the same time we see README file in the profile of our github account where we write about ourself.<br>
            <h4>Here's what they suggest you initially in README file when you're new in github</h4>

            <h3>Code editor</h3>
            <p>
                It is place where we write our code. These days a<b>VS Code</b> editor is one of the most popular code
                editor application. The key advantages of using visual studio code is<br>
                -Variablility: We can code almost all programming as well as non programming languages in vs code
                editor.<br>
                -Speed: It do not lag much as compared to other code editor.<br>
                -User interface: User feel comfortable while writing code in vs code.<br>
                -Extensions: Vs code offers all essential extensions which programmer usually needs.<br>
            <h5>Download vs code</h5>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_main">download</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                After we download vs code editor and set it up.<br>
                We create folder and files in it.<br>
            </p>

        <div class="clone">
            <h3>Clone</h3>
            <p>
                Clone: When we want to fetch the repository files we use clone command to clone remote repo into local
                space.<br>
                Clone command:<br>
                <i>git clone &lt-https url of code section on your repository-&gt</i>

                -which files are to be commited<br>
                -which files are modified<br>
                We use this command:<br><br>
                <i>git status</i>

        <div class="create_new_file_and_folder">

            <h4>To create new file we use</h4>
            <i>touch &lt;-name of file-&gt;</i><br>

        </div>
        <div class="change_directory">
            <h3>Directory</h3>
            <p>
                Directory are all the files inside your folder which are forming the tree. Say path where you are
                writing
                your code is <b>mypc.codes.html.learn-git</b> then these all extended folder are known as directory.
                So, when you are writing another code in different file you can use this command to get access to those
                codes.<br>
                For now say path of that code is <b>mypc.codes.html.learn-other</b> then First we return to parent file
                only after that we enter into the expected code file.<br>
            <h4>To go back to parent file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd ..</i>
            <h4>To go into the children file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listing">
            <h3>Listing</h3>

            <h3>To list visible files we use:</h3>
            <i>ls</i>
            <h3>To list hidden files we use:</h3>
            <i>ls -a</i>&nbsp;
            But sometimes <i>ls -a</i>&nbsp;may not work because <i>-a</i>&nbsp;is a ambigiuous command which means it
            hold more than one executive results.<br>
            <h4>In that case we use:</h4>
            <i>ls -force</i>
            </p>

            <h3>Stage and Commit</h3>
            <p>
            <h5>when you are done with the coding you can use these commands and steps to upload your work in github.
            </h5>
            <b>Step 1: Stage your file</b><br>
            Staging is nothing but to save your file in local device as a file ready to commit. Think of it like
            dragging your few out of many projects in code editor to the stage so that you can publish those chosen one
            in open source.
            <h4>Use this command to stage your file</h4>
            <i>git add &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i><br><br>
            <b>Step 2: Commit your file</b><br>
            When you commit your file it is almost into your remote repository. When we commit any file it means we are
            done with modifying content in our project.
            We take the real advantages of commit when we create different branches in repositories to use unique hash
            of commited file. Each commited file has a unique hash with it.
            <h4>Use this command to commit your files</h4>
            <i>git commit -m &lt;-message for what changes you made this time in this project-&gt;</i><br><br>
            <p>Before you push your file first check this out</p><br>
            <a href="remote.html" target="_main">Click Here</a><br><br>
            <b>Step 3:Push committed file</b><br>
            This is final step when you are working in any project. After you push your file it gets uploaded in your
            github account with amazing looking green boxes in your github profile.<br>
            <h4>Use this command to push your commited file</h4>
            <i>git push origin main</i>
            </p>
            <p>Congratulations you sucessfully published your project into github account.</p>

            <h4>Few useful commands</h4>

            <h4>To unstage the staged files we use</h4>
            <i>git restore --stage &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i>
            <h4>To stage all files we use</h4>
            <i>git add .</i>

            <h4>To delete any branch</h4>
            <i>git branch -d &lt;-branch name-&gt;</i>
            <h4>To jump over branch</h4>

            <h4>To merge branches</h4>
            <i>git merge &lt;-brach name-&gt;</i>
            When we merge braches it gets merged remotely not locally. We use pull command to fetch data from remote
            access to local access.<br>
            <h4>Pull commands</h4>
            <i>git pull origin &lt;-branch name-&gt;</i>
