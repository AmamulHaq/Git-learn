            <h3>What is README.md?</h3>
            README is nothing but the description about the project or anything as comparable as that.<br>
            For example: We create Readme file in any repository branch to write what the project is about.<br>
            At the same time we see README file in the profile of our github account where we write about ourself.<br>
            <h4>Here's what they suggest you initially in README file when you're new in github</h4>
