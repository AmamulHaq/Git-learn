            <h3>What is README.md?</h3>
            README is nothing but the description about the project or anything as comparable as that.<br>
            For example: We create Readme file in any repository branch to write what the project is about.<br>
            At the same time we see README file in the profile of our github account where we write about ourself.<br>
            <h4>Here's what they suggest you initially in README file when you're new in github</h4>

                -which files are to be commited<br>
                -which files are modified<br>
                We use this command:<br>

        <div class="change_directory">
            <p>
            <h3>To change directory</h3><br>
            Directory are all the files inside your folder which are forming the tree. Say path where you are writing
            your code is <b>mypc.codes.html.learn-git</b>then these all .extended folder are known as directory. So,
            when you are writing another code in different file you can use this command to get access to those
            codes.<br>
            For now say path of that code is<b>mypc.codes.html.learn-other</b>then First we return to parent file only
            after that we enter into the expected code file.<br>
            <h4>To go back to parent file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd ..</i>
            <h4>To go into the children file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="listing">
            <p>
                <h3>To list visible files we use:</h3>
                <i>ls</i>
                <h3>To list hidden files we use:</h3>
                <i>ls -a</i>
                But sometimes <i>ls -a</i>may not work because <i>-a</i>is a ambigiuous command which means it hold more than one executive results.<br>
                <h4>In that case we use:</h4>
                <i>ls -force</i>
            </p>
