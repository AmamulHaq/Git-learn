            <h3>What is README.md?</h3>
            README is nothing but the description about the project or anything as comparable as that.<br>
            For example: We create Readme file in any repository branch to write what the project is about.<br>
            At the same time we see README file in the profile of our github account where we write about ourself.<br>
            <h4>Here's what they suggest you initially in README file when you're new in github</h4>

                <h4>To create new file we use</h4>

            <h3>To change directory</h3><br>
            Directory are all the files inside your folder which are forming the tree. Say path where you are writing
            your code is <b>mypc.codes.html.learn-git</b>then these all .extended folder are known as directory. So,
            when you are writing another code in different file you can use this command to get access to those
            codes.<br>
            For now say path of that code is<b>mypc.codes.html.learn-other</b>then First we return to parent file only
            after that we enter into the expected code file.<br>
            <h4>To go back to parent file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd ..</i>
            <h4>To go into the children file we use:</h4>
            <i>cd &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i>

                <i>ls</i>
                <h3>To list hidden files we use:</h3>
                <i>ls -a</i>&nbsp;
                But sometimes <i>ls -a</i>&nbsp;may not work because <i>-a</i>&nbsp;is a ambigiuous command which means it hold more than one executive results.<br>
                <h4>In that case we use:</h4>
                <i>ls -force</i>

                <h5>when you are done with the coding you can use these commands and steps to upload your work in github.</h5>
                <b>Step 1: Stage your file</b><br>
                Staging is nothing but to save your file in local device as a file ready to commit. Think of it like dragging your few out of many projects in code editor to the stage so that you can publish those chosen one in open source.
                <h4>Use this command to stage your file</h4>
                <i>git add &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i><br><br>
                <b>Step 2: Commit your file</b><br>
                When you commit your file it is almost into your remote repository. When we commit any file it means we are done with modifying content in our project.
                We take the real advantages of commit when we create different branches in repositories to use unique hash of commited file. Each commited file has a unique hash with it.
                <h4>Use this command to commit your files</h4>
                <i>git commit -m &lt;-message for what changes you made this time in this project-&gt;</i><br><br>
                <b>Step 3:Push committed file</b><br>
                This is final step when you are working in any project. After you push your file it gets uploaded in your github account with amazing looking green box in your github profile.<br>
                <h4>Use this command to push your commited file</h4>
                <i>git push origin main</i>
            </p>

        <div class="useful_commands">

                <h4>To unstage the staged files we use</h4>
                <i>git restore --stage &lt;-file_name-&gt;</i>
                <h4>To stage all files we use</h4>
                <i>git add .</i>
