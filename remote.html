        Before publishing your committed file you need to follow these steps<br>
        <h4>Rename branch name</h4>

        Previously in github there used to be master branch but nowadays the main branch is considered the <br>initial branch. Main branch implementation is done by github but vs code editor haven't yet <br>implemented the change. Hence, we rename branch name.
        <h5>Use this command to rename branch</h5>
        <i>git branch -M main</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        After that we add origin to the repository<br>
        <h5>Use this command to add origin</h5>
        <i>git remote add origin &lt;-https url from the code section of respective branch-&gt;</i><br><br>
        After this we push our file into github main origin branch<br>
